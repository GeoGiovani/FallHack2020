<h1> Fall Hack 2020: Hackathon </h1>

Our project centers on the battle between 2 blocks as they battle for survival, using power ups and speed to knock each other across the map. Whichever block can knock the other one off the screen first wins!

Use WASD to play as Blue, and the the arrow keys to play as Red.

Scattered throughout the map are pieces of Wild Power. These power ups may make you bigger and better, or just kill you entirely! Eat one to find out!

Try to avoid the walls, while also pushing your opponent into them. The last block alive wins!

To Build:
Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.

Run 'npm start' to run. 

The game will be running on "http://localhost:3000" (port 3000)
